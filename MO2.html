<p><b>How computer science can help fight COVID-19</b><br>
    he COVID-19 pandemic has mobilized the world’s scientific community like no other recent crisis, including many researchers using the most modern<br>
     data science and artificial intelligence approaches At the University of Chicago, public health experts, computer scientists, economists andpolicy<br>
      analysts  have launched projects using computational tools to better detect, diagnose, treat and prevent the spread of the deadly virus. This summer,<br>
       three of these projects received seedfunding from the C3.ai Digital Transformation Institute (DTI), a new partnership of technology companies<br>
         and universities committed to accelerating the benefits of artificial intelligence for business, government and society. The research attacks<br>
          the pandemic from several angles: helping policymakers control disease spread  by identifying and addressing key social factors, physicians detect <br>
          the disease at earlier stages, and hospitals decide  which patients require admission. A fourth project, a collaboration led by UChicago Medicine’s <br>
          Maryellen Giger, was fundedby the organization in spring.The awards were part of $5.4 million in funding distributed by DTI, after their   inaugural<br>
           call for proposals in March. The group also provides AI software tools and a “data lake” of COVID-19    datasets to aid researchers studying the pandemic<br>
           .“The enthusiastic response among scientists and researchers  coupled with the diverse, high-quality and compelling proposals we’ve received suggests<br>
            that we have the potential to alter the course of this global pandemic,” said Thomas M. Siebel, CEO of C3.ai. “In the face of this crisis,the Institute<br>
             is proud to bring together the best and brightest minds and provide direction and leadership to support objective analysis and AI-based, data-driven <br>
             science to mitigate COVID-19.”<br> <strong>for more information </strong>
