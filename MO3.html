    <b>Digital technology applications for contact tracing: the new promise for COVID-19 and beyond?</b><br>
    Among the most critical strategies in the fight against the Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) is the rapid tracing and notification of potentially infected persons.<br>
     Several nations have implemented mobile software applications (“apps”) to alert persons exposed to the coronavirus. The expected advantages of this new technology<br>
      over the traditional method of contact tracing include speed, specificity, and mass reach. Beyond its use for mitigating and containing COVID-19, digital technology<br>
       can complement or even augment the traditional approach to global health program implementation. However, as with any new system, strong regulatory frameworks are<br>
        necessary to ensure that individual information is not used for surveillance purposes, and user privacy will be maintained. Having safeguarded this, perhaps the global<br>
         health community will witness the beginning of a new era of implementing mass health programs through the medium of digital technology.<br>

<b>Extensive benefits of digital infrastructure application for global health</b><br>
For some global health experts, the use of digital technology in the context of COVID-19 marks the ushering in of a promising<br>
 new milestone in the implementation of mass intervention Besides contact tracing, diverse digital infrastructure taking the form <br>
 of Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT), big data, and machine learning have played intergral roles in the efficientprevention<br>
  and management of the new SARS-CoV-2 disease [7, 8]. Present applications of this technology are expanding to include the development<br>
   of precision treatments for patients with COVID-19,streamlining of clinical workload, drug and vaccine discovery efforts, and predictive<br>
    analytics to forecast the trajectory of outbreaks Broadly considered, digital and AI-based interventions for global health replicate the basic<br>
     principles of health programming in key ways. Fundamentally, it respects individual autonomy through opt-in/opt-out features which allow<br>
      target populations to indicate or refuse consent to participate. Secondly, digital technology minimizes the burden of participation by <br>
      eliminating the need for continuous self-reporting. Thirdly, automated processescircumvent any recall bias from the infected person,<br>
       in addition to other potential human errors and gaps in data reporting. Lastly, and perhaps most important for the infected persons <br>
       is the advantage of reducing the stigmatizing effect of face-to-face interviews with the official contact tracing Investigation Team. <br>
       Recommendations on regulatory frameworks for data privacy and protect it Despite  the promise of digital interventions for global health,<br>
        precautionary measures must be responsibly exercised. Governing authorities are to ensure that policy frameworks include strong protections<br>
         for the privacy of users. By the same token, international or national laws should guarantee that data collected in the interest of public<br>
          health are not ulteriorly used for retaliatory or surveillance purposes.Established norms and principles governing digital technology and<br>
           telecommunications also matter in the “context of international security” [8]. With growing internet use, criminal activity by hackers <br>
           havefrequently targeted vital State and civilian information in the cyberspace. Moreso in extreme cases, such as international armed conflicts<br>
           , direct attacks on digital infrastructure enabling the delivery of publicservices can cause deliberate harm. Thus international humanitarian<br>
            laws ought to be amended to govern responsible State behavior concerning civilian information available in the cyberspace. International lawshould<br>
             oblige States to enact protective measures to prevent cyberattacks on digital infrastructure [9].Of critical note, it is recommended that at<br>
              the design stage digital program implementation specialists carefully consider any potential threats against the proper inclusion of vulnerable<br>
               populations. Preventive measures against the exploitation of these populations may incorporate the simplification of consent language or<br>
    the availability of audio/visual translations for handicapped persons.<br>
