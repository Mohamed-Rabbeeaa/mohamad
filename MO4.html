    What does a software engineer in biomedicine do? It may be easier to list what a software engineer in biomedicine does not do.<br>
     According to the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS), engineering in biomedicine is a fast growing specialty <br>
     and lucrative career path for engineers. Software engineers are important in many facets of biomedical engineering and science. <br>
     Most medical devices require software to function. Developing and maintaining that software is an important job of the biomedical<br>
      software engineer. Biomedical researchers look to software engineers to develop algorithms for data analysis and biological system <br>
      modeling. Software engineers are important in the clinical setting, developing systems that aid the clinician in medical records,<br>
       patient diagnosis, patient monitoring, and clinical decision making. These are just a few examples of the type of work a software<br>
        engineer can do in biomedicine.<br>
