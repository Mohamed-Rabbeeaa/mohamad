    <b>The value of artificial intelligence and imaging diagnosis in the fight against COVID-19></b><br>
    The outbreak of the new type of coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) has caused a huge impact on the world. In this case, only by adhering to the prevention and<br>
     control methods of early diagnosis, early isolation, and early treatment, can the spread of the virus be prevented to the greatest extent. This article uses<br>
      artificial intelligence–assisted medical imaging diagnosis as the research object, combines artificial intelligence and CT medical imaging diagnosis, introduces <br>
      an intelligent COVID-19 detection system, and uses it to achieve COVID-19 disease screening and lesion evaluation. CT examination has the advantages of fast speed<br>
       and high accuracy, which can provide a favorable basis for clinical diagnosis. This article collected 32 lung CT scan images of patients with confirmed COVID-19.<br>
        Two professional radiologists analyzed the CT images using traditional imaging diagnostic methods and artificial intelligence–assisted imaging diagnostic methods,<br>
         and the comparison showed the gap between the two methods. According to experiments, CT imaging diagnosis assisted by artificial intelligence only takes 0.744 min <br>
         on average, which can save a lot of time and cost compared with the average time of 3.623 min for conventional diagnosis. In terms of comprehensive test accuracy,<br>
          it can be concluded that the combination of artificial intelligence and imaging diagnosis has extremely high application value in COVID-19 diagnosis.<br>
